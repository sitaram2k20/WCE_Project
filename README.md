Real Time traffic light Detection using camera as receiver fixed on car and transmitter as traffic light


The code is written in matlab  [Matlab_Code.m]

The simulation images [SimulationImages] were created by 3D modelling (Blender) application.

These images are sample images that were captured by high-speed cameras attached at front of the vehicle.

The Project detect the trafficlight response based on these sample images and then car can perform certain function based on traffic light state.

The reference paper availble in folder [ReferencePapers] that were being used to create the final paper and develop the algorithm from scratch.  

The paper [FinalPaper_Report.pdf] is in full details explaining the contribution, thought process, how we develop the algorithm and final results that we obtained.
